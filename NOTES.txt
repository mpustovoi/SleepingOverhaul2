Flow from player activating bed

BedBlock#use
 - Explodes the bed if !canSetSpawn(level)
 - If occupied, tries to kick-out villager, otherwise shows occupied error
 - Calls ServerPlayer#startSleepInBed, putting problem result into bedSleepingProblem...
    ...if assigned, sends the problem message to player
    ...if null, returns success.

ServerPlayer#startSleepInBed
 - Does all the usual game logic checks to see if player is allowed to sleep:
    - Ensures dimension is of type "natural";
    - Ensures in range and not obstructed;
    - Ensures the level is not day;
    - Checks for mob safety (non-creative mode only);
 - Calls super - Player#startSleepInBed - if success, awards sleeping advancement
 - Checks getLevel().canSleepThroughNights(), shows message if not, but doesn't abort? Eh? Raid stuff?
 - Calls ServerLevel#updateSleepingPlayerList()

Player#startSleepInBed
 - Calls LivingEntity#startSleeping and sets sleepCounter to 0
    - Sets player position and stuff, also calls setSleepingPos.
